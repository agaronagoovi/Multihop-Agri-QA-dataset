# SOYBEAN: AN INTRODUCTION Classification of States in six major Soybean growing zones: Soybean is majorly grown in the following areas

## TILLAGE

• Deep ploughing is essential during summer, after harvesting the Rabi crop. This facilitates exposing the hibernating insects to extreme heat and predatory birds as well as movement of nutrients and infiltration of soil water. Therefore, one deep ploughing once in 3-4 years, otherwise one normal ploughing in summer followed by 2 criss-cross harrowing or cultivation for breaking of soil clods will make ideal seed bed for a good crop of soybean cultivation is recommended. Also, sub-soiling operation once in 4-5 years at an interval of 10 meter, break the compactness of the sub-soil and also facilitate infiltration of rainwater which is useful for un-interrupted crop growth even during drought period also.


## USE OF ORGANIC MANURE

• In order to have sustainable soybean yield, it is very important to maintain soil health. Hence, farmers are advised to incorporate organic manure (well decomposed FYM @ 5-10 t/ha or Poultry Manure @ 2.5 t/ha) at the time of land preparation. If the quantity of organic manure is limited, they are advised to apply the same on rotation basis in their fields every year. • In case of saline soil (pH >7.5), it is also advised to apply Gypsum @ 150-200 kg/ha along with FYM/Poulty manure before the last harrowing in case the nutritional requirement is to be planned without sulphur sources for maintenance of soil pH. Similarly, in acidic soil (pH less than 6.5) it is advised to used lime @ 600kg/ha.


## HARROWING

• Soon after arrival of monsoon, the land may be prepared by harrowing followed by planking to level the field.


## SOWING TECHNIQUES:

• Since its commercial cultivation, soybean has traditionally been sown using dufan (animal drawn two row) and tifan (animal drawn three row). With increase in mechanization and availability of tractor drawn seed drills, farmers are using these multi-crop seed drills having adjustable row-to-row distance and seed rate as per the necessity of the crops. Normally the seed drill has provision of flat sowing 5-9 rows of soybean crop with adjustable row to row distance of 14-18 inches. Looking to the prevailing climatic aberrations and erratic rainfall, following methods can be used to mitigate the adverse climate.


## a. Sowing on Broad Bed Furrow:

The BBF seed drills have a provision of opening the irrigation channels after an interval of 4-5 rows. The furrow mechanism is fitted on both the end of BBF seed drills.


## b. Sowing on Ridges & Furrows: FIRB Seed drill developed by the Indian Institute of Soybean

Research (IISR) can be used for sowing each row/paired rows on ridges.


## ZONE WISE RECOMMENDED VARIETIES

• In order to avoid risk of yield reduction due to aberrant climatic situation and biotic factors, farmers are recommended to grow 3-4 soybean varieties with varying maturity periods (Varietal Cafeteria Approach) in their fields. Different varieties possess resistance/tolerance to particular insect-pest and diseases. Long duration soybean varieties are able to give more yields subject to application of irrigation in event of early cessation of monsoon.

• Farmers are advised to select 3-4 varieties popular among their zone and ensure the availability of seed of these varieties well in advance i.e. before sowing. The detailed information related to list of recommended and notified soybean varieties suitable for different zone/states is given in table 1.


## Table 1: Details of notified soybean varieties and their characteristics

The following soybean varieties are listed along with their characteristics for the Central Zone. In the Central Zone, which includes Madhya Pradesh, Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and the North-West region of Maharashtra.

1. The first variety is JS 20-116 (2019). It has a maturity range of 95-100 days and can yield up to 30 quintals per hectare. This variety is semi-determinate and features rounded ovate leaves, white flowers, excellent germination, and the absence of pubescence. It has a black hilum and shows multiple resistance against yellow mosaic virus, charcoal rot, rhizoctonia aerial blight, bacterial pustules, leaf spots, stem fly, and stem borers. It is also suitable for mechanical harvesting. 2. The second variety in the Central Zone is JS 20-94 (2019) 


## SEED GERMINATION TEST

Farmers are advised to check germination status of seed purchased/available with them before sowing. To ensure optimum plant population and thereby good yield, minimum 70% germination is essential. This can be done through sowing of 100 seeds in 1mX1m plot and it is kept moist. From 5-8 days emergence is counted everyday till the count is stabilized. The germination test can also be done by placing 100 seeds in between two newspaper sheets and rolling them with a moist cloth.


## SEED TREATMENT & INNOCULATION

• Seed treatment is very important operation in soybean considering number of fungal, bacterial and viral diseases which causes considerable reduction in plant population and thereby yield. Hence, farmers are advised to treat soybean seed at the time of sowing using premixed Penflufen + Trifloxystrobine 38 FS @ 1 ml/kg seed or Carboxin 37.5 + Thiram 37.5 @ 3g/kg seed or with2g Thiram+1gCarbendazim per kg seed or Trichoderma viride @ 8-10 g/kg seed.

• In areas where Yellow Mosaic Virus and Stem fly are affecting the soybean crop every year, farmers are recommended to carry out seed treatment with Thiamethoxam 30 FS (10 ml/kg of seed) or Imidacloprid 48 FS@ 1.25 ml/kg seed. • Once the seed treatment with fungicides and insecticide is done, farmers are advised to inoculate the treated seed with bio-inoculants like Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Phosphate Solubilizing Mircro-organism (PSM) each @ 5 g/kg seed immediately before sowing. If the soybean is grown in nontraditional/new area, they should increase the quantity of bioinoculants to at least 10 g/kg seed.

o Farmers are also advised to follow correct sequence of seed treatment with recommended fungicides followed by insecticide and seed inoculation (FIR). Similarly, seed treatment with fungicides as well as seed inoculation in mixed form simultaneously should be avoided as the microorganisms present in the culture are destroyed. However, if Trichoderma viride has to be used, all the three bio-agents can be used in one go after seed treatment with insecticide.


## SOWING TIME, SPACING & SEED RATE FOR SOYBEAN

The zone-wise details of recommended date of sowing, seed rate and spacing is given in table 3 given below.


## Zone-wise recommended sowing time, seed rate and spacing for Soybean

1. In the North Eastern Hill zone, the recommended sowing time for Soybean is between 15th June and 30th June. The seed rate is 55 kg per hectare, and the recommended spacing is 45 cm. 2. For the North Plain zone, the recommended sowing time for Soybean is from 20th June to 5th July. The seed rate is slightly higher at 65 kg per hectare, while the spacing remains the same at 45 cm. 3. In the Eastern zone, the sowing time for Soybean is the same as the North Eastern Hill zone, between 15th June and 30th June. The seed rate is 55 kg per hectare, and the recommended spacing is also 45 cm. 4. Moving to the Central zone, the recommended sowing time for Soybean is from 20th June to 5th July. The seed rate increases to 65 kg per hectare, and the spacing remains at 45 cm. 5. In the Southern zone, the sowing time for Soybean is also between 15th June and 30th

June. The seed rate is 65 kg per hectare, and the recommended spacing is narrower at 30 cm.

These recommendations consider the specific characteristics and requirements of each zone to optimize the soybean cultivation process.

• Since soybean is a rainfed crop grown during kharif season, it is sown only after the arrival of monsoon. Farmers are advised to sow their crop only after 100 mm rainfall is received to ensure germination and development of the plant till next spell of rains. • The sowing of soybean seed may be done either using traditional tools like bullock drawn Dufan/Tifan/seed drill or by using tractor drawn machines like Seed-cum-Fertilizer drill, BBF/FIRB Seed Drill keeping row to row spacing of 30cm (for short duration and dwarf varieties) or 45 cm (for medium and long duration varieties) and plant to plant spacing of 4-5cm at 3 cm depth. Care should be taken that the bold seeded varieties be placed at shallow depth. In case of delayed sowing on account of late onset of monsoon, farmers are advised to narrow the row spacing at 30 cm and increase the seed rate by 25% in order to optimize plant population and avert the likely yield loss due to slow growth. Care should be taken to sow the bold seeded varieties at shallow depth. • The seed rate and germination percentage are inversely proportional to seed size of soybean varieties. The small seeded varieties are excellent in germination compared to bold seeded varieties. Therefore, the seed rate should be modified accordingly in order to achieve optimum plant population and yield. The recommended seed rate for soybean varieties having medium seed size (JS 20-29, JS 93-05, JS 20-69) is 65 kg/ha while for bold seed varieties (JS 95-60, JS 20-34), the seed rate should be increased to 75 kg/ha. The seed rate for small seeded varieties like NRC 37 and JS 97-52 should be reduced to only 45-50 kg/ha. • Immediately after sowing, it is advised to apply the spray of any recommended preemergence herbicide but before emergence of soybean. The list of recommended herbicides is given in table 5.


## MANURES & FERTILIZERS

• Soybean is considered to be moderately exhaustive crop. Balanced nutrients application ensures better yield performance of soybean. The integration of Farm Yard Manure (5-10 t/ha) or poultry manure (2.5t /ha) along with the basal application of N: P2O5:K2O:S (as given in table 4) generally provides balanced nutrition for harnessing the yield potential. In soybean, use of fertilizers is recommended only as basal application. Therefore, farmers are advised not to use any fertilizers particularly urea or DAP as top dressing in standing crop unless being recommended by soybean scientists. In general, for harvesting good soybean yield, it requires recommended dose of NPKS which can be accordingly tailored after soil testing. • Farmers are also advised not to mix fertilizers along with seed during sowing of soybean. In close contact with fertilizer it gets rotten in the soil. They should ensure the placement of seed at 3 cm and the fertilizer placement at 5 cm in the soil.


## Zone wise Fertilizer dose recommended for soybean

The recommended fertilizer doses for soybean cultivation in different zones are as follows:

• In the North Eastern Hill and Eastern zones, the recommended fertilizer dose is 25 kg of nitrogen (N), 100 kg of phosphorus (P), 50 kg of potassium (K), and 50 kg of sulfur (S) per hectare. The recommended fertilizer sources for this dose are 56 kg of urea, 625 kg of single super phosphate (SSP), and 84 kg of muriate of potash (MoP). • For the North Plain zone, the recommended fertilizer dose is 25 kg of N, 75 kg of P, 25 kg of K, and 37.5 kg of S per hectare. The corresponding fertilizer sources for this dose are 56 kg of urea, 470 kg of SSP, and 42 kg of MoP. • In the Central zone, the recommended fertilizer dose consists of 25 kg of N, 60 kg of P, 40 kg of K, and 20 kg of S per hectare. To achieve this dose, 56 kg of urea, 375 kg of SSP, and 67 kg of MoP are recommended as fertilizer sources. • Lastly, in the Southern zone, the recommended fertilizer dose is 25 kg of N, 80 kg of P, 20 kg of K, and 30 kg of S per hectare. This can be achieved by applying 56 kg of urea, 500 kg of SSP, and 34 kg of MoP as fertilizer sources.

These recommended fertilizer doses and sources are tailored to the specific nutrient requirements of soybean cultivation in each zone, aiming to provide optimal nutrition for healthy plant growth and maximum yield.

The fertilizer dose may be supplemented through addition of recommended quantity of organic manures.


## WATER MANAGEMENT

• Since last few years the distribution of rainfall was found to be uneven and erratic. Long dry spells, particularly during critical growth stages like seedling, flowering and pod filling affect the yield adversely. Hence, farmers are advised to apply lifesaving irrigation (before the development of soil cracks) during these critical stages in order to sustain yield levels. • Farmers are advised to use BBF or Ridge and Furrow methods for soybean planting in order to mitigate the climatic adversities. The BBF or FIRB seed drill machines developed by ICAR-IISR can be used for the same. The furrows opened by these machines also facilitate application of irrigation during long dry spell/drought too.


## HARVESTING & THRESHING

• Optimum time of harvesting is very important for soybean as it causes yield loss due to shattering and seed viability loss due to field weathering. • Initiation of change of pod color (physiological maturity) of soybean is the right indication to go for harvesting. At this time, the moisture percentage of soybean seed is around 14-16%.

Hence, the farmers are advised not to wait till the foliage/plant turns yellow. Harvesting can be done when 95% pod changes color from green. • The harvested soybean crop, after sun drying for 2-3 days is ready for threshing. Because of sowing of subsequent crop if threshing is to be performed later, the harvested soybean should be collected preferably on threshing floor and covered with tarpoline to avoid damage from rain/shattering. To maintain viability of the seed and to avoid loss/mechanical damage, threshing should be done at 350-400 rpm. • The threshed soybean should again be allowed to sun drying for 3-4 days in order to bring down the moisture up to 10% which is essential to avoid fungal infection during storage. • The storage place should be cool with aeration and insect free. The soybean bags should be kept upright as far as possible. If stacking is to be done, it should be only up to 4-5 bags of not more than 5 feet height (using platform) in order to maintain the viability/germination of soybean seed. • While moving the seed bags to storage house, it should be carefully placed at the appropriate place/platform. The seed bags should not be in direct contact with floor/wall. The moisture seepage in the walls/floor may be a source of infection of diseases, hence can be avoided for storage.


## STRATAGIES TO MITIGATE DROUGHT/ LONG DRY SPELL IN SOYBEAN

• Soybean is, by and large, grown as a rainfed crop during kharif season. Since last few years, the distribution of rainfall was found to be uneven and erratic. Farmers are advised to use BBF or Ridge and Furrow methods for soybean planting in order to mitigate the climatic adversities. In case of flat sowing, if there is a long dry spell, particularly during critical growth stages affect the yield adversely. Hence, farmers are also advised to apply lifesaving irrigation during these critical stages in order to sustain yield levels.

• The institute has developed sub-soiler which is useful for more infiltration of rainwater/conservation of soil moisture. Use of this machine has recently been recommended considering the long dry spells/drought situation prevailing in most of the areas. Therefore, depending upon the availability of this machine, one can go for this operation once in 4-5 years.

• In absence of these machines, a very simple technique of making conservation furrows after every 3/6/9 rows of soybean will facilitate both to conserve moisture as well as drain out excess water from the field to a certain extent. During long dry spells, the crop sown on flat land should carry out inter-culture (dora/kulpa/hoeing) operation to reduce moisture loss from soil during early growth period (upto one month from sowing). Farmers should also spray the crop with anti-transpirants like KNO3 / MgCO3 (1%) or Glycerol (5%) during long dry spells in order to save the crop from drought. Alternatively, farmers can use crop straw @ 5 t/ha after emergence of soybean crop for mitigating the adverse effect of drought.


## WEED MANAGEMENT

• Weeds cause soybean yield losses of 25-85% if not controlled. Yield losses depend on the time of weed occurrence, types of weeds and duration of weeds present in the field. Weed management is very important operation in Vertisols and associated soils because of continuous rains and congenial environment. Weeds compete with soybean for nutrition and other natural resources at very higher rate. Hence, their management is very essential at appropriate stage. This can be done using various methods i.e. mechanical, agronomical and chemical weed control. • The critical period of weed crop competition in soybean is 30-45 DAS. Therefore, the weeds should be managed during this period. Two hand weeding at 20 & 40 DAS or intercultural operation (Hand hoe/Dora/Kulpa) using bullock drawn/tractor drawn implements during critical period is found beneficial. In situ mulching of weeds at 30 DAS is also beneficial for controlling weeds as well as to conserve soil moisture and add the organic matter in the soil. If it is not feasible due to continuous rains particularly in vertisols, then one can opt for chemical weed control. In this situation, farmers are advised to use recommended herbicides.

For soybean crop, they are divided in to three categories

(1) Pre-plant incorporation (PPI) herbicides, (2) Pre-emergence (PE) herbicides and Post-emergence (PoE) herbicides.

The detailed information about the time of application, active ingredient and quantity is given table 5. It is also advised to select any one of the recommended herbicides considering the type of weeds i.e. monocot/dicot prevalent in his field. Pre-mix formulations are also recommended for control of both type of weeds. Instead of using same herbicides every year, herbicide rotation is desirable.

Farmers are advised to carry out inter-culture operation (dora/kulpa) at 20-25 DAS in case of use of PPI/PE herbicides. To control the weeds effectively, it is very necessary to make the appropriate spraying solution and its uniform spray on entire area/weed foliage. Hence, farmers are advised to use 500 litre of water per hectare along with recommended quantity of herbicides using Flat Fan or Flood Jet nozzle.


## Herbicides recommended in Soybean

The following herbicides are recommended for effective weed control in soybean cultivation.

For pre-plant incorporation (PPI), a combination of Pendimethalin and Imazethapyr is recommended at a quantity of 2.5-3 liters per hectare.

For pre-emergence (PE) weed control, multiple options are available.

• Diclosulum 84 WDG can be applied at a rate of 26 grams per hectare.

• Sulfentrazone 48 SC can be used at a quantity of 750 milliliters per hectare,

• Chlomozone 50 EC requires 2.00 liters per hectare.

• Pendimethalin 30 EC should be applied at a rate of 3.25 liters per hectare,

• Pendimethalin 38.7 CS can be used at 1.5-1.75 kilograms per hectare.

• Flumioxazin 50 SC is recommended at 250 milliliters per hectare,

• Metolachlor 50 EC at 2 liters per hectare, and • Metribuzin 70 WP at 0.75-1 kilogram per hectare.

• Another option is a combination of Sulfentrazone and Clomazone, to be applied at a quantity of 1250 milliliters per hectare. • Pyroxasulfone 85 WG is recommended at 150 grams per hectare.

For post-emergence (PoE) weed control at 10-12 days after sowing (DAS), Chlorimuron ethyl 25 WP can be applied at a rate of 36 grams per hectare, while Bentazone 48 SL application requires it to be 2.0 liters per hectare.

For post-emergence weed control at 15-20 DAS, several options are available.

• Imazethapyr 10 SL should be applied at a rate of 1.00 liter per hectare, \ • Quizalofop-ethyl 5 EC at 1.00 liter per hectare, • Quizalofop-p-ethyl 10 EC at 375-450 milliliters per hectare, • Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 9.3 EC at 1.00 liter per hectare, • Quizalofop-p-tefuryl 4.41 EC at 1.00 liter per hectare, • Fluazifop-p-butyl 13.4% EC at 1-2 liters per hectare, • Haloxyfop R Methyl 10.5 EC at 1-1.25 liters per hectare, and • Imazethapyr 70% WG + Surfactant at 100 grams per hectare.

• Additionally, Propaquizafop 10 EC can be used at a rate of 0.5-0.75 liter per hectare, and • Fluthiacet methyl 10.3 EC at 125 milliliters per hectare.

For post-emergence premix formulations at 15-20 DAS, Fluazifop-p-butyl + Fomesafen can be applied at a rate of 1 liter per hectare, Imazethapyr + Imazamox at 100 grams per hectare, and Propaquizafop + Imazethapyer at 2.0 liters per hectare. Lastly, Sodium Aceflourofen + ClodinafopPropargyl can be used at a quantity of 1.0 liter per hectare.

These herbicides are recommended for specific stages of weed growth to ensure effective weed management in soybean crops. It is important to follow the recommended dosage and application instructions for optimal results and to minimize any potential negative impact on the environment.


## MANAGEMENT OF MOST IMPORTANT PESTS




## WHITE GRUB (व्हाइट ग्रब / सफ़े द ग्रब)

Recently this insect has gained significance in soybean crop in some pockets of Madhya Pradesh. The grubs feed on plant roots in rows. Consequently, drying of plants in linear patches become visible. The grubs feed voraciously under good soil moisture conditions. For management of white grub, following measures are to be adopted.

(1) Installation of light trap or pheromone traps for collection and destruction of white grub adults.

(2) Seed treatment with Imidachloprid 48 FS @ 1.25 ml/kg seed.

(3) Soil application of Chlorpyrifos (2.5% granular) @16 kg/ha between the rows at 25-30 days after sowing.


## GRAM POD BORER (ग्राम फली छ़े दक) & TOBACCO CATERPILLAR (तम्बाक ू कै टरपिलर / तं बाक ू इल्ली)

Every year, the soybean crop is reported to be increasingly infested by Gram pod borer as well as Tobacco Caterpillar resulting in heavy yield losses. They are polyphagus with more egg laying capacity and recently they have developed resistance to many popular insecticides. Hence, farmers are advised to adopt following control measures:

(1) Use of recommended seed rate.

(2) Install insect-specific pheromone trap at 4-5 locations in the field. Care should be taken to use clean cloth while handling the septa.

(3) Use bird perches at 8-10 locations in the field facilitating easy access for birds to feed on insect larvae.

(4) Regular monitoring of the field and destruction of egg mass/caterpillar in early stage of tobacco caterpillar.

(5) Spray the crop with biological pesticides like HaNPV 250 LE/ha for Heliothis and SlNPV 250 LE/ha or Bacillus thuringiensis / Beauveria basiana @ 1 l/ha. (6) If needed, spray Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC@ 0.15 l/ha or Spinetoram 11.7 SC @ 450 ml/ha or Quinalphos 25 EC @ 1.5 l/ha or Indoxacarb 14.5 SC @ 0.5 l/ha or Betacyfluthrin + Imidacloprid @ 350 ml/ha or Flubendiamide 39.35 SC (@ 150 ml/ha) or or Flubendiamide 20 WG (@ 250-300 g/ha) or Thiamethoxam + Lambda Cyhalothrin (125 ml/ha) using 500 litre of water per hectare.


## GREEN SEMILOOPER (हरा त़े ला / ग्रीन स़े ममल ू िर / हरा स़े मील ू िर / चऩे का कीडा)

Soybean is infested by a complex of semiloopers. Differing in colour, shape and size, the young larvae initially cut small holes on foliage and later on completely devour the plants. In the event of heavy incidence, they also damage buds, flowers and young pods resulting in non-pod formation situation. Its infestation is found to be more in the areas with less rain coupled with high temperature and humidity and causes heavy yield losses. Farmers are advised to follow control measures as given below:

(1) Use recommended seed rate. Avoid higher plant population as it attracts the insect causing heavy infestation.

(2) Avoid higher use of nitrogenous fertilizers as it invites more insects.

(3) Use bird perches at 8-10 locations in the field facilitating birds to feed on insect larvae.

(4) Regular monitoring of the field and destruction of egg mass / caterpillar in early stage.

(5) Spray of biological insecticides Bacillus thuringiensis/Beauveria basiana @ 1 l/ha at early stage. (6) Spray Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC@ (0.15 l/ha 4-5 days before flowering. Alternatively, farmers can use Quinalphos 25 EC @ 1.5 l/ha or Indoxacarb 14.5 SC @ 0.5 l/ha or pre-mix insecticides like Betacyfluthrin +Imidacloprid @ 350 ml/ha or Thiamethoxam + Lambda Cyhalothrin (@ 125 ml/ha)or Flubendiamide39.35 SC (@ 150 ml/ha) or Flubendiamide 20 WG (@ 250-300 g/ha)using recommended quantity of water ie.500 l/ha.


## GIRDLE BEETLE (चक्र

During recent years, this insect is found to be most commonly seen in major soybean growing states. Generally, its typical infestation is seen after 25 days from sowing. This is a stemboring insect, owes its significance due to its intricate life cycle. Insects hatching from eggs laid during July and first fortnight of August complete the life cycle during the same crop seasons itself. But those hatching from eggs laid during second fortnight of August and September over winter as prepupa and complete the life cycle only after the onset of monsoon in the following year. The infested plants / plant parts show typical drooping and drying due to girdles made by the female for egg laying. Following control measures are suggested for management of this insect.

(1) Use recommended seed rate. Avoid higher plant population as it attracts the insect causing heavy infestation.

(2) If possible, plant trap crop like Dhaincha on the field boundaries which attract the beetle thereby protecting the soybean crop.

(3) Destroy the affected plant part during the initial stage of infestation in order to break the life cycle of the insect.

(4) Spray the crop with Thichloprid 21.7 SC @750 ml/ha or or Profenophos 50 EC @ 1250 ml/ha or Betacyfluthrin + Imidacloprid @ 350 ml/ha or Thiamethoxam + Lambda Cyhalothrin (@ 125 ml/ha) during the initial infestation of girdle beetle.


## PRECAUTIONS TO BE FOLLOWED IN USE OF INSECTICIDES

a. Insecticide and quantity of spray solution: Depending upon the crop stage, soybean requires 500 lit spray solution per ha with knapsack sprayer and 120 lit/ha with power sprayer. Spraying with less quantity will not give desired results.

b. Time of spray and use of appropriate nozzle: Insecticides should be sprayed in morning or in evening. Cone Nozzle is found to be best suitable for spray of insecticides which ensure evenly distribution. Also, power sprayer as well as boom sprayer are the suitable alternatives for both required quantity of water as well as time and labor.

c. Repeating insecticide spray: Insecticides are usually effective for 10-15 days. If at all second spray is required, use different insecticide of the same category (contact or systemic). This is essential to prevent development of insecticide resistance in insects.


## IPM STRATAGIES RECOMMENDED BY ICAR-IISR

1. Summer deep ploughing: Deep ploughing during summer facilitates exposing the hibernating insects to extreme heat and predatory birds.


## Proper sowing time:

Crop sown during June end escapes damage due to stem fly. Whereas girdle beetle infestation can be minimized by delayed sowing in July 3. Optimum/Recommended seed rate, spacing and plant population: Higher seed rate results in more densely populated soybean crop which attracts more insects. Further, it promotes lodging resulting in yield loss. Hence, the optimum seed rate of (60-80 kg/ha) depending on seed size & germination with recommended spacing (30-45 cm x 5cm) is recommended.


## Selection of insect resistant/tolerant variety:

Varieties recommended for a particular agroclimatic zone, should only be used. Cultivation of marginally less yielding but insect-resistant or tolerant variety is always remunerative.


## Balanced nutrition:

Use of excessive nitrogenous fertilizers leads to more incidence of defoliators and girdle beetle. Therefore, use optimum quantity of recommended nutrients only. Use of potassium improves crop health and provides resistance against insect-pests. 


## 6.




## Light Trap:

Adult moths of most of the defoliating larvae are nocturnal, and are attracted towards light source. These should be collected with the help of "Light Traps" and destroyed.

By doing so, adults can be prevented from mating and laying eggs and the crop can be saved. Light traps are also useful for attracting adults of white grubs.


## Pheromone Trap:

Infestation by Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera litura can be minimized through specific pheromone traps. These traps not only help in monitoring the incidence but also for mass trapping the adults. Care should be taken that the pheromone septa are not touched with bare hands while fixing on the trap.


## Bird Perches:

In order to exploit the potential of insect-predatory birds, "T" shaped bird perches should be installed in the fields. Anthracnose disease is incited by Colletotrichum truncatum fungus. It occurs in severe form at time of continuous and prolonged drizzling along with high humidity. Pathogen survives in seed, soil and crop residues. Sunken, dark brown lesions develop on the cotyledons of seedlings. Seedling lesions may expand to the stem and kill young plants. Crop can be infected at all growth stages but symptoms are evident in the early reproductive stage on stems, petioles and pods. Generally, irregular reddish to dark brown areas appear on infected parts. Later on these are covered by black fungal fruiting bodies (acervuli) with setae (minute black spines), which can be seen by unaided eye. These are diagnostic character of the disease. Foliar symptoms are expressed in the form of laminar veins necrosis, leaf rolling, yellowing of leaves with brown spot and defoliation of leaves under prolonged period of high humidity. Owing to infection, pods turn yellow to brown and twisted, seed formation is also affected as they become brown, shriveled and mouldy, and sometimes seeds do not form in the pods. Sometime leaves remain green while only pods turn yellow to brown. The disease can be prevented by seed treatment with recommended chemicals. The YMV has a wide host range, which includes pulses and weeds. Farmers are advised to carry out seed treatment with Thiamethoxam 30 FS @ 10 mL/kg of seed or Imidachloprid 48 FS @ 1.25 mL/kg seed. Further, in order to control white fly, spray the crop with Thiamethoxam 25WG @ 100 g/500 litre water/ha immediately after the symptoms are visible. Further, prophylactic spray with any of the above mentioned chemicals may be given at 21 days after sowing.


## YELLOW MOSAIC VIRUS (YMV) (िीला




## RUST (सोयाबीन रस्ट

This is a disease of fungal origin caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi. Very often, it is observed during the flowering stage. Rains during these period (July-September) result in low temperature (22-27oC) and high humidity (80-90%) keeps the leaf surface moist/wet for 3-4 hours continuously which further increases the chances of incidence of rust. Night/morning fog also increases the possibility of rust infection. Pathogen survives mainly in collateral hosts. Initially chlorotic gray brown spots appear on the leaves, abundantly on lower surface. Slowly spots increase in size to form pustules. Eventually, leaves turn brown within short time causing early defoliation and reduction in number of pods, seeds and seed weight. Presence of loose brown powder owing to rupture of pustules is a characteristic symptom. For management of rust disease avoid rabi soybean. Rouging may be done for the self grown plants in rabi season. During the initial stage of the disease, spray the crop with Hexaconazole 5% EC @ 800 ml/ha, may be sprayed at 15 days interval considering the severity of disease. In areas where rust is reported on regular basis, crop rotation and/or inter-cropping with maize, sorghum, maize, pigeon pea or cotton are recommended to avoid the incidence of disease. Further, prophylactic spray with any of the above recommended chemical may be given at 35-40 days after sowing. Early sowing of soybean (May) under irrigated condition is also found a useful tool for escaping from rust particularly in rust prone areas of Southern Maharashtra and Northern Karnataka.


## Recommended chemicals and mode of application for disease control in soybean

The following chemicals and modes of application are recommended for disease control in soybean:

For seed treatment, Thiophanate methyl 45% + Pyraclostrobin 5% FS should be applied at a dose of 3 grams per kilogram of seed to control diseases such as charcoal rot, anthracnose, pod blight, collar rot, purple seed stain, and frog eye leaf spot. Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% can also be used at a dose of 3 grams per kilogram of seed. Penflufen + Trifloxystrobine 38 FS should be applied at a dose of 1 milliliter per kilogram of seed to control diseases such as charcoal rot, anthracnose, pod blight, collar rot, purple seed stain, and frog eye leaf spot.

Thiamethoxam 30 FS can be used at a dose of 10 milliliters per kilogram of seed to control yellow mosaic virus (YMV) and yellow mosaic India virus (YMIV). Imidacloprid 48 FS is also recommended at a dose of 25 milliliters per kilogram of seed.

For foliar application, the first spray should be done during the initiation of the disease, and the second spray should be applied after 15 days based on disease severity. Tebuconazole + Sulphur can be used at a dose of 1 kilogram per hectare to control anthracnose and pod blight. Tebuconazole alone should be applied at a dose of 625 milliliters per hectare to control charcoal rot. Pyraclostrobin 20% w/w WG can also be used at a dose of 500 grams per hectare to control charcoal rot.

Spray of Thiamethoxam 25 WG is recommended at a dose of 100 grams per hectare to control YMV and YMIV. This spray should be done 20-25 days after sowing as a preventive measure and immediately after the initiation of symptoms.

These recommended chemicals and modes of application are targeted at specific diseases affecting soybean crops. It is important to adhere to the recommended dosages and application timings for effective disease management and to minimize any potential negative impact on the crop and the environment.

"against defoliators. Different neem products like, neem oil, seed extract, leaf extract etc. act"
"as feeding deterrent for leaf eating insects. Consequently, insects get repelled from the crop."
Continuous starvation leads to insect death in a few days.
11. Trap crop: Intercropping of soybean with: Suva (in 6:1 or 12:2 row ratio) helps in trapping the insects on
Suva crop and saving the main soybean crop. Insects on Suva can be controlled with very less
quantity of insecticide
12. Use of microbial insecticides: Application of commercially available microbial insecticides like
"DiPel, Biobit, Delfinetc (Bt based) or Larvocel, Biosoft, Dispel or Biorin (Beauveria bassiana"
fungus based) @ 1.0 kg/ha can help in controlling defoliating larvae without adverse effect on
"natural enemies, parasitoids and predators. For control of tobacco caterpillar and gram pod"
"borer, insect specific Nuclear Polyhydrosis Virus like Virin S/Biovirus S or Virin H/Biovirus H"
can be used for spraying on the soybean crop.
MAJOR DISEASES OF SOYBEAN & THEIR MANAGEMENT
```
10. Use of botanical insecticides:
**Caption:** Simple water extracts of Acacia arabica (leaves or seeds), Anethum graveolens (Suva) is excellent trap crop for most of the defoliators.Disease is incited by Macrophomina phaseolina fungus, which also causes dry root rot, ashy or stem blight. The infection of soybean usually occurs early in the season during seedling emergence and early growth stages. These seedling infections remain latent until environmental stresses (drought and high ambient temperatures ranging from 30-40oC) occur during the R1 (flowering) -R7 (mature pod) growth stages which may cause yield loss up to 77%. Imbalanced fertilizer application and high plant density influence disease prevalence and severity. The pathogen is soil and seed borne. Infected plants produce slightly smaller leaflets than healthy plants and have reduced vigor. As the disease advances, leaflets turn yellow followed by browning and wilting. The brown leaves remain attached to the petioles. A light gray of silver discoloration is visible in the taproot and lower stem, when plants are split open. Black specs (microsclerotia) will be visible in this tissue of the stem and tap root. The control measures for the disease are given inTable 8-9.It is a soil borne, caused by Sclerotium rolfsii. Hot and humid conditions favour the disease. Pathogen attacks collar region and causes damping off in younger and collar rot in older plants resulting drooping or wilting of plants. The characteristic symptom is formation of white cottony mycelium with reddish brown to dark brown mustard size sclerotia on the surface. The disease can be prevented by carrying out seed treatment with recommended fungicides. (id: tab_2)

**Caption:** YMD caused by Mungbean Yellow Mosaic India Virus (MYMIV) is one of the important constraints to soybean in Central India, while Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV) in South India. Initially small yellow patches or spots appear on young leaves. The next trifoliate leaves emerging from the growing apex show irregular yellow and green patches alternating with each other. The yellow discoloration slowly increases and newly formed leaves may completely turn yellow. Infected leaves also show severe mottling and crinkling of leaves. The infected plants normally mature late and bear a very few flowers and pods. The pods are small and distorted. The early infection causes death of the plant before seed set. The infection results in decrease in oil. The virus is sap transmitted and spread by white fly Bemisia tabaci in semi persistence manner. (id: tab_3)

Destruction of infested plants:
**Caption:** Bihar hairy caterpillar and tobacco caterpillar are gregarious feeders at initial stage and the infested plants are easily spotted in the field. Removal and destruction of such plants prevents larvae to migrate to and damage other plants. Likewise, girdle beetle infested plants are also easily recognized by dried portion above the girdles. Up to 30-45 days, remove the infested plant parts from below the girdles to destroy eggs and grubs of girdle beetle. Regular scouting and monitoring helps. (id: tab_1)
