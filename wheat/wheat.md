## CLIMATE

Wheat crop has wide adaptability. It is primarily a temperate crop but is widely cultivated in subtropical regions and is grown even in some tropical countries.

• Ideal temperature for germination of wheat seeds is around 20-23 o C though these can germinate in temperature range of 3.5 to 35 o C.

• During the heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures and drought are harmful to wheat.

• The temperature conditions at the time of grain filling and development are very crucial for yield.

• Temperatures above 25 o C during grain filling and development period tend to depress grain weight. When temperatures are high, too much energy is lost through the process of transpiration by the plants and the reduced residual energy results in poorer grain formation and lower yields.


## SOIL TYPE

• Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. • Care should be taken to avoid very porous and excessively drained oils.

• Heavy soil with poor structure and poor drainage are not suitable as wheat is sensitive to water logging. • Wheat can be successfully grown on lighter soils provided their water and nutrient holding capacity are improved.


## VARIETIES

In India, different zones have specific recommendations for wheat varieties and sowing times to optimize the cultivation process. Let's explore the recommendations for each zone: 


## LAND PREPARATION

• Level the field. (Field leveling is more beneficial if done with laser leveler.)

• One ploughing with mould board plough. After that 2-3 cross harrowings followed by planking.

• If there is less moisture in the field, then irrigate the field before sowing (paleva) and prepare the field by running harrow/cultivator if there is suitable moisture.


## SEED GERMINATION TEST

• Seed germination test should be conducted to check seed germination status of seed. To ensure optimum plant population and thereby good yield, minimum 85% germination is essential.


## SEED TREATMENT

• Seed treatment with Carboxin (75 WP @ 2.5 gm/kg seed) or Carbendazim (50 WP @ 2.5 gm/kg seed) or Tebuconazole (2DS @ 1.25 gm/kg seed) or a combination of a reduced dosage of Carboxin (75 WP @ 1.25 gm/kg seed) and a bioagent fungus Trichoderma viride (@ 4 gm/kg seed) is recommended.


## SPACING

• Timely sown: 20-22 cm • Late sown: 15-18 cm • At the time of sowing, sow the seeds at a depth of 4 to 5 cm • If sowing is to be done by broadcasting method, then increase the quantity of seed by 25% and make sure that there is enough moisture in the field and the seeds should be scattered evenly.


## SOWING TIME, SEED RATE AND FERTILIZER APPLICATION

The time of sowing has slight variation from zone to zone and under varying production conditions. The information for the commercial cultivation of wheat crop under different systems is given in table below.

In the Northern Hills Zone (NHZ), it includes the western Himalayan regions of Jammu and Kashmir (except Jammu and Kathua districts), Himachal Pradesh (except Una and Paonta Valley), Uttarakhand (except Tarai area), Sikkim, and the hills of West Bengal and the northeastern states. Following is the sowing time, seed rate and fertilizer application methodology

• If wheat is irrigated and sown in a timely manner between 1st and 20th November, the recommended seed rate is 100 kg per hectare. For fertilizer application, it is advised to apply 120:60:40 kg NPK per hectare, with 1/3 of the nitrogen (N) and the full phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) as basal at the time of sowing. The remaining nitrogen should be applied in two equal splits at the first and second irrigation. • For late sowing in the NHZ after 25th November, the seed rate is increased to 125 kg per hectare, and the fertilizer dose is adjusted to 90:60:40 kg NPK per hectare.

In the North Western Plains Zone (NWPZ) and North Eastern Plains Zone (NEPZ): The NWPZ comprises Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan (except Kota and Udaipur divisions), western Uttar Pradesh (except Jhansi division), certain parts of Jammu and Kashmir (Jammu and Kathua districts), certain parts of Himachal Pradesh (Una district and Paonta Valley), and certain parts of Uttarakhand (Tarai region). North Eastern Plains Zone (NEPZ) includes eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Assam, and the plains of northeastern states.

• For irrigated and timely sown wheat (NWPZ: 1st-20th Nov., NEPZ: 10th-25th Nov.), a seed rate of 100 kg per hectare is recommended. The fertilizer application for these conditions is 150:60:40 kg NPK per hectare, with 1/3 of the nitrogen and the full phosphorus and potassium applied as basal at sowing. The remaining nitrogen should be applied in two equal splits at the first and second irrigation. • For late sowing after 25th November, the seed rate is increased to 125 kg per hectare, and the fertilizer dose is adjusted to 120:60:40 kg NPK per hectare.

In the Central Zone (CZ), Peninsular Zone (PZ), and Southern Hills Zone (SHZ), Central Zone (CZ): The CZ consists of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Kota and Udaipur divisions of Rajasthan, and Jhansi division of Uttar Pradesh. Peninsular Zone (PZ) consists of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, and the plains of Tamil Nadu fall within the PZ. Southern Hills Zone (SHZ) encompasses the hilly areas of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, specifically the Nilgiri and Palni hills of the southern plateau. Following is the sowing time, seed rate and fertilizer application methodology

• For irrigated and timely sown wheat (CZ: 10th-30th Nov., PZ: 1st-25th Nov., SHZ: 15th Nov.-30th Nov.), the recommended seed rate is 100 kg per hectare. The fertilizer application for these conditions is 120:60:40 kg NPK per hectare, with 1/3 of the nitrogen and the full phosphorus and potassium applied as basal at sowing. The remaining nitrogen should be applied in two equal splits at the first and second irrigation. • For late sowing (CZ & SHZ: 1st-15th Dec., PZ: 25th Nov.-10th Dec.), the seed rate is increased to 125 kg per hectare, and the fertilizer dose is adjusted to 90:60:40 kg NPK per hectare.

For rainfed conditions in all zones and states under those zones, a seed rate of 125 kg per hectare is recommended, and the fertilizer dose is 60:30:20 kg NPK per hectare to be applied at the time of sowing.

These recommendations provide guidance on seed rates and fertilizer application for different sowing conditions in each specific zone, helping farmers make informed decisions for successful wheat cultivation.


## APPROACHES FOR IMPROVING SOIL HEALTH

Following strategies may help in reversing the adverse effects on soil:

• Adoption of resource conservation technologies like zero tillage & happy seeder.

• Residue management -Incorporation or surface residue retention to enhance the soil organic matter.

• Developing new and improving the available machinery for residue management and conservation agriculture. • Introduction of leguminous crops like moong bean to regain & build up the soil health.

• Green manuring to increase soil organic matter.

• Balanced use of fertilizers

• Application of NPK in proper proportion along with FYM and need based application of Zn, Mn, Fe, Cu, Mo and B as micro-nutrients for optimum yields.


## APPLICATION OF MICRONUTRIENTS

For Zinc deficiency:

• Zinc sulphate at the rate of 25 kg/ha once in a year or 10 kg/ha to each crop during rabi and kharif season. If zinc deficiency symptoms are visible in the crop then spray 0.5 % zinc sulphate solution.

For Manganese deficiency:

• A spray 0.5% solution of MnSO4 is advisable. Dissolve 2.5 kg MnSO4 in 500 liter of water per ha. First spray should be done 2-5 days before first irrigation and remaining 2-3 sprays at one week internal.


## For Sulphur deficiency

• Soil application of sulphur or spray application can be resorted for correcting deficiency. Apply Sulphur 80% WDG @ 8-10 kg/ha at the time of sowing or just before first irrigation.


## WEED MANAGEMENT

Wheat is infested with both grasses and broad-leaved weeds. Basis weed and type of herbicide used, these chemicals can be used for their control.

The recommended doses and times of application for various herbicides in grassy and broad-leaved weeds are as follows:

Grassy weeds: Avena ludoviciana (Wild oat/Jangali Jai), Phalaris minor (Mandusi/Kanki), Polypogon monsplensis (Lomar ghas), Poa annua (Poa grass). Following are herbicides and dosage for the mentioned grassy weeds 


## IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT

The normal practice of applying 4 to 6 irrigations are enough for wheat crop. However, crown root initiation and flowering stages are the most critical to moisture stress. Depending upon the water availability, irrigation should be applied as per the schedule. 


## SYMPTOMS

• Termite damage the crop soon after sowing and near maturity.

• The damaged plants dry up completely and are easily pulled out.

• The plants damaged at later stages give rise to white ears.


## CONTROL

• Seed treatment with thiamethoxam 70WS @ 0.7 g a.i./kg seed (4.5 ml product dose/kg seed) or fipronil @ 0.3 g a.i./kg seed or 4.5 ml product dose /kg seed) is also very effective.


## APHIDS (एफिड / aphis / एफिड् स / द्रु र्यू कम / र्मह):




## SYMPTOMS

• Aphids damage the crop resulting in discolouration of leaves.

• Aphid infestation above economic threshold level of 5 aphids per ear head (recorded from 10 randomly selected ear heads in each of the 4 quarters of one-acre field) is dangerous.


## CONTROL

• For the management of aphids, foliar spray of Imidacloprid 200SL @20g a.i./ha on border rows at the start of the aphid colonization be given.


## PINK STEM BORER (गु लमबी तनम छे दक / से सफर्यम इनि े रें स / फ िं क स्टे र् बोरर / Sesamia inferens):




## SYMPTOMS

• Pink stem borer generally attacks the wheat crop at seedling stage.

• The larva bore into the stem of young plant and kills the central shoot causing 'dead heart'.


## CONTROL

• For its management, foliar spray of Quinalphos 2000 ml/ha as soon as pink stem borer is seen. Irrigation also helps in reducing the pink stem borer damage. 


## EAR COCKLE (कमन




## CONTROL

• Farmers should adopt floatation technique for the separation of galls from the infested seed lots.

• The infested seed lot should be floated in 2% brine solution for this purpose. The galls will float on the surface. These should be separated and destroyed away from the field by burning.

• The seed should be thoroughly washed to remove the salt solution before sowing. 


## DISEASES




## SYMPTOMS

• Yellow Rust (P. striformis) Yellow powdery pustules appear on leaves, forming stripes.

• Brown or leaf rust (P. triticina): Round, orange powdery pustules, irregularly arranged or in clusters on leaves, less common on the leaf sheath and stalk.


## CONTROL

• Spray the crop with Propiconazole (@ 0.1 %), or Tebuconazole (@ 0.1%) at stripe rust initiation using 200 litres of water/acre. 


## LOOSE SMUT (ढीलम




## SYMPTOMS

• The fungus destroys the ears completely, turning them into a black loose powdery mass consisting of spores and leaving behind the rachis only.


## CONTROL

• Seed treatment with Carboxin (75 WP @ 2.5 gm/kg seed) or Carbendazim (50 WP @ 2.5 gm/kg seed) or Tebuconazole (2DS @ 1.25 gm/kg seed).


## KARNAL BUNT (करनमल बिं ट / आिं फिक बिं ट / कवक फटले फसयम इिं फडकम):




## SYMPTOMS

• It is a seed borne disease.

• In the ear only, a few grains are infected.

• The infected grains on pressing give out black powder of spore mass. This powder gives peculiar stinking smell.


## CONTROL

• One spray of Propiconazole 25EC @ 0.1% using 200 litre/acre of water be given at 50% flowering. If conditions are favourable for the disease then repeat at an interval of 15 days to control the disease.

POWDERY MILDEW ( मउडर रू ी िि ू िं द / मउडरी फर्ल्ड्यू / ख़स्तम िि ू िं दी / खरमा / दफियम):


## SYMPTOMS

• Powdery mildew can easily be diagnosed by the white, powdery patches that form on the upper surface of leaves and stem. • Powdery growth later become black lesion and cause drying of leaves and other parts.


## CONTROL

• One need-based spray of Propiconazole (@ 0.1%) can be given at ear head emergence or appearance of disease on flag leaf, whichever is earlier.

FLAG SMUT (झिं डम धू फर्ल / फ्लै ग स्मट / त्तोिं की यम िवज कमिं फगयमरी / गे हिं कम ध्वज क िं ड):


## SYMPTOMS

• Long narrow lead grey or black streaks or stripes running parallel to veins are formed on the leaves. • The stripes eventually rupture and expose black sooty mass of spores.


## CONTROL

• Seed treatment with Carboxin or Tebuconazole may be followed in fields with flag smut history.

(Measures taken for the control of loose smut disease proved to be effective against flag smut too.)


## Good Agricultural Practices

• Choose the best suitable variety for your area and condition.

• Seed treatment with T.viride (@4g/ kg seed) + Carboxin @1.25g/kg seed) or Tebuconazole (@ 1.0g/kg seed) for the control of seed borne diseases. • Follow timely planting and avoid delay in sowing of wheat crop to avoid yield losses due to adverse effects of heat around maturity. • Do not grow varieties from other zones to avoid risk of disease susceptibility.

• Manage your crop with optimum inputs (fertilizer, irrigation water, herbicides, and fungicides) for maximum yield. • Timely and judiciously irrigate fields to save water and cut costs.

• Harvest crop at proper maturity to minimize risk due to shattering, threshing etc.

• Follow proper storage practices for wheat produce to avoid post-harvest losses.


## PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES FOR RESOURCE CONSERVATION




## Laser land levelling

• It is a process of smoothening the field within ± 2 cm from the average elevation of the field using laser equipped bucket, which scraps from higher places and spread onto the low-lying areas.

• This may result higher yields due to proper crop stand, uniform fertilizer and water distribution, crop growth, uniform maturity and increased cultivable area by 3 to 6% due to reduction in area under bunds and channels.


## Zero tillage

• In this technology, wheat seed and fertilizers are directly placed at proper depth into the undisturbed soil after rice harvesting using a specially designed machine which creates narrow slits by the knife type furrow openers of zero tillage ferti-seed drill instead of shovel type furrow opener in conventional ferti-seed drill.


## Advantages

• Saving of time, drudgery, water, labour, money and energy as well as less wear and tear of machinery. • Helps in advancing the sowing of wheat by 7 to 10 days which is very useful especially under late sown conditions where basmati rice/ cotton/ sugarcane harvesting is delayed beyond 25th November.


## Happy seeder (िै प्पी सीडर)

• Happy seeder is tractor mounted machine that cuts and lifts paddy straw, sows wheat seed into the bare soil and deposits the straw over the sown area as mulch.

• It allows the farmers to sow wheat immediately after the harvesting of rice without burning the residue. • The wheat seeds with happy seeder is sown in the standing stubbles of rice which avoids the preparatory tillage and crop can be sown 7-10 days earlier as compared to traditional method of sowing.


## HARVESTING & THRESHING

• When the moisture level of grain is 25% it is the proper time for manual harvesting. Generally, wheat is manually harvested but for quick harvesting, combine harvester should be used to avoid losses in grain yield due to shattering and lodging. • Wheat should be harvested 4-5 days before it is dead ripe. Morning is the best time for harvesting. • Mechanical harvesting through combine machine is done at places where uniform ripening of wheat happens. • In case of manual harvesting, bundles are made and dried for 3-4 days and threshed by thresher. Before storage, grain should be dried by spreading on tarpaulin plastic sheets in bright sunlight to a moisture level below 12%.


## STORAGE OF WHEAT

For storage, use bins and silos made of GI sheets. Now a days, aluminium bins, Pusa bins, silos and poly lined bags are available for storage. Farmers can store wheat grains in their traditional storage as well. Improved storage structures of various capacities are now available.

• The air-tight bin can be used. It is so constructed that it does not allow entry of any outside insects and rodents and the insects present in the grain do not get favourable atmosphere to develop. • For filling and using the metal bin, the following storage practices are recommended:

o Clean the bin thoroughly and do not allow the left-overs of the previously stored grains to remain in the bin. Inspect the covers to ensure that the gaskets are intact. o Clean and sort the grains of all impurities. Broken kernels and other impurities lead to insect attraction and, hence, should be separated. o Do not mix the new grains with old stock as the latter may be infested with insects.

o Never store infested grains, or grains with high moisture content. Dry the grains out in the sun, cool it and fill in the bin later in the evening. The moisture content of the grains should not be higher than 9 %. o Fill-in the bin to full capacity and tight the lid properly.

o Do not open the bin for the first 30 days and thereafter open it fortnightly. The cover should be replaced immediately after use. o Inspect the grains frequently.


## OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY

• Children below the age of 14 should not be employed in any work.

• Children below the age of 18 should not be allowed to undertake dangerous and hazardous work.

• Children should not be exposed to work which physically or psychologically or sexually abuse them.

• Educate everyone in your village and make sure that they send their children to school.

• Don't employ any worker in the farm based on bond or for debt and also not against his/her consent.

• Never abuse a worker and his/her family physically or verbally or sexually and treat all the workers equally.

• Don't ask any worker to deposit any amount or original documents or valuables before employment.

• Pay a minimum wage to workers based on local law. Don't hold the payment to the worker on any grounds beyond the prescribed payment date.

• Don't allow any worker to work in a hazardous work environment like handling and spraying of Crop Protection Agents, without a proper PPE kit and prior training.

• Don't allow pregnant women, Children, and Adolescents to handle Crop Protection Agents.

• After the application of Crop Protection Agents don't allow anyone to enter the field before the prescribed re-entry time. Make sure that you keep first aid items in the reach of any emergency. The workers are entitled to take leaves and given holidays on national holidays and festivals.
